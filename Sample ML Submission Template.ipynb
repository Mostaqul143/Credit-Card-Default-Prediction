The objective was to explore the data and gain insights that could help predict the probability of default payments, with a focus on estimating the probability rather than a binary classification.\n","\n","The dataset contained various features including customer demographics, credit card details, and payment history. The columns included ID, LIMIT_BAL, SEX, EDUCATION, MARRIAGE, AGE, PAY_0 to PAY_6 (representing payment status over the last six months), BILL_AMT1 to BILL_AMT6 (representing bill statement amounts), PAY_AMT1 to PAY_AMT6 (representing payment amounts), and the target variable, default payment next month.\n","\n","In conclusion, this EDA project provided valuable insights into the credit card default payment dataset from Taiwan. By exploring the data and understanding the relationships between variables, it is possible to predict the probability of default payments more accurately. The findings from this analysis can be used to develop models and strategies for risk management in the credit card industry, assisting in mitigating financial losses and making more informed decisions."]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"w6K7xa23Elo4"},"source":["# **GitHub Link -**"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"h1o69JH3Eqqn"},"source":["https://github.com/Mostaqul143"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"yQaldy8SH6Dl"},"source":["# **Problem Statement**\n"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"DpeJGUA3kjGy"},"source":["Problem Statement:\n","\n","**The problem at hand is to predict the probability of default payments for credit card customers in Taiwan.**\n","\n","**The focus is on estimating the probability rather than a binary classification of credible or not credible clients.**\n","\n","**Risk management is crucial for credit card companies, and accurate prediction of default payments can help mitigate financial losses.**\n","\n","**The dataset consists of various features such as customer demographics, credit card details, and payment history.**\n","\n","**The goal is to conduct an Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset and identify patterns that can aid in predicting default payments.**\n","\n","**Key questions to address include understanding the relationship between variables, identifying significant predictors, and exploring any notable trends or outliers.**\n","\n","**The outcome of the EDA will inform the development of models and strategies for risk management in the credit card industry.**"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"mDgbUHAGgjLW"},"source":["# **General Guidelines** : -  "]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ZrxVaUj-hHfC"},"source":["1.
