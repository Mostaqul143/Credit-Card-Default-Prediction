# Credit-Card-Default_Prediction


# Defaulted  Analysis:
This repository contains the analysis of the Credit Card Defaulter dataset. The analysis aims to predict Credit Card Default Or Not.

# Dataset:
The dataset used for the analysis contains information on various features such as Sex, Marriage, Education, and Age and so on... It also includes the target variable, which is the Defaulted

# Analysis Steps:

**Data Exploration:** Perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset, identify patterns, and understand the distributions and relationships between variables.

**Data Preprocessing:** Clean the data by handling missing values, removing outliers, and encoding categorical variables.

**Feature Engineering**: Create new features or manipulate existing features to minimize feature correlation and improve model performance.

**Feature Selection:** Use techniques like VIF (Variance Inflation Factor) to identify and select important features for the predictive models.

**Model Building:** Train and evaluate various regression models, such as Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, RandomForestRegressor, XGBRegressor, etc.

**Model Evaluation:** Assess the performance of the models using evaluation metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) score.

**Hyperparameter Tuning:** Fine-tune the model hyperparameters using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search to improve the model's performance.

**Conclusion:** Summarize the key findings from the analysis, including the most accurate model and the significant features affecting the bike rental count.

# Results

Here are the key findings from the analysis:

The Logistic Regression model, after hyperparameter tuning, achieved the Accuracy Score 68.5% And  Recall Score of 64.8%.

The RandomForest Classification  and XGBoost Classification  also performed well, achieving accuracies of 80.5% and 81.4% respectively.
